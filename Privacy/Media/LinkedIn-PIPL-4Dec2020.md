2020 has been a year of Privacy Laws being passed by countries around the world with #gdpr  being the catalyst and 2021 will not be any different.

Peoples' #privacy Republic of #China (PRC) has also produced the first draft of their Personal Information Privacy Law (PIPL), which as all things related to China is already controversial.

"As for how to get ready for #pipl , that is not so easy to set out. Much is delegated to future instruments. However, those organizations that are meeting GDPR standards will be well-placed to navigate the requirements as they are finalized."
