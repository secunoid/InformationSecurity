== Overview
Everything in this world is centered around information, knowledge, which translates into a generic term _data_.  This data can be about individuals, places, or things.  Regardless of who or what it is about it is important to protect it.

There exists approximately 4,294,967,296 (four billion two hundred ninety-four million nine hundred sixty-seven thousand to hundred ninety-six) IPv4 Addresses.  This pool is 32-bits in size.  Scanning these addresses is an embarrassingly parallel workload and ca be easily distributed over any number of systems.  The term embarrassingly parallel simply means that little or no effort is needed to seperate this problem into a number of parallel tasks.  Password cracking and 3d video rendering are also examples o this type of problem.

=== Non-living Entities
Data about non living entities when modified leads to mis-information and currently in the digital age our ability to provide the authenticity of that data is very difficult.  If the source is trustworthy, then we deem it authentic, currently there are no mechanisms to ensure that the data has not been modified in between from when the trustworthy source released and to the time it got to you.

=== Living Entities
Data about living entities, especially us humans is very valuable.  With the devices we carry, and use in our daily lives, we are constantly producing data, every hour, every second of our lives.

== What is information security?
The foundation of information security is based on three pillars also known as the *triad*

. Confidentiality
. Integrity
. Availability

== Why are they important?
What is the the topic of discussion, *Information Security* , there two key words here *information* and *security*, viz a viz securing information.

You have to condition yourself to always think about what protecting,  the *information*.  Once you get this concept the rest is easy.

Then think of how does this information move in the environment.  Information of any type goes through follwoing lifecycle stages, also knows as CRUD:

. Create
. Read
. Update
. Delete


The sections below will build upon them.

=== Confidentiality
NIST defines "Confidentiality" as Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.

=== Integrity
NIST defines "Integrity" as Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.

=== Availability
NIST devines "Availability" as Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.


<<<
== Privacy
Centralization has very damaging impacts to a users privacy.  Once the user has provided their information to an entity, they are at entities' mercy for data protection.

Certain states want to keep 

Data that is being processed by the solution should care fully considered for:

. Data protection: Based on data classification ensure data is protected in storage and in transit.
. Data retention: Based on regulatory, and industry requirements,  data should be retained for 
. Data access & update: Allow end users ability to access their data and modify it as required.

Governments across the world are responding to the global cyber security crisis by creating new regulations that govern the way companies handle and store valuable consumer data. This includes important information such as personal identifications, banking and credit card numbers, and purchase history.

=== GDPR
The European Union, in particular, has been a leader in this field. One of its pioneering efforts is the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) what was passed in 2016 and went into effect in Spring 2018. It impacts all companies that do business with European customers, regardless of where the company is located.

The GDPR requires that companies receive consent from consumers before processing data, collect and store data anonymously, and notify customers when their information has potentially been breached. It also requires large businesses to appoint a data privacy protection officer to oversee implementation of the regulations.

=== CCPA
Furthermore, while the U.S. federal government has yet to create a set of strong data privacy protections, several states have drawn up their legislation, including Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Washington.

However, the most important of these regulations come from California, the largest state in the country by population with nearly 40 million residents. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and governs the way companies must store and secure data.

CCPA allows consumers to demand crucial information about their personal data held by corporations.

When requested, businesses must inform consumers about the type of personal data they possess, provide them with specific personal information collected in the previous year, and allow customers to request that their information not be shared with third parties. Companies will also have to delete customer data when requested.

=== PIPL
On 1 November 2021, the new Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s Republic of China will enter into force. This law, adopted on 20 August 2021, is an omnibus privacy law that will apply to all organisations doing business in China or targeting people in China, and has major compliance consequences similar to GDPR.

== Data Protection

=== Methodology
. Define what to classify
. Define where to classify
. Define who applies classification
. Define conditions
. Assign labels to users and groups
. Define Access rights
. Create classification policies
. Test Classification policies
. Deploy classification policies
. Monitor and accelerate remediation

=== Know your data
. Where is my sensitive data 
located? 
. What are the risky activities happening in my organization – files shared externally, across 1st and 3rd party apps?
. I need to comply with a new regulation? Where is my PII data located & where is it being generated? 
. How do I control data sprawl and build a strategy for ROT before I bring data
. How do I see activity around classification and labeling across retention and sensitivity labels once they have been used across governance and retention outcomes?
. How do I monitor  ongoing risk around label activity?


=== Password Strength
Brute force password cracking - the importance of using a long password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase and special characters.

Assuming an attacker has a reasonably fast connection and PC, the table is an estimate of the amount of time it would take to generate every possible combination of passwords for a given number of characters. After generating the list it's just a matter of time before the computer runs through all the possibilities – or gets shut down trying.

Pay particular attention to the difference between using only lowercase characters and using all possible characters (uppercase, lowercase, and special characters – like @#$%^&*). Adding just one capital letter and one asterisk would change the processing time for an 8 character password from 2.4 days to 2.1 centuries.

== Logical Security
Logical controls are about physical aspects of the information protection.  The computer system is housed in a building in a particular area.  Depending on the sensitivity of the information various mechanisms are put in place like:

* Fenced building perimeter
* Gates at the entry and exit points
* Guards manning those gates to ensure that only authorized individuals are allowed through the gates

Now working through the layers just like peeling an onion. You have gone through the first layer the perimeter. Now once in the perimeter it has to be ensured:

* Ensuring protections are in place to prevent vehicles damaging the building via direct impacts
* Split the building into zones with different levels of access levels for the personnel and this can be gated & guarded area
* Ensure computer room is in the middle of the building without any window access
* The computer room can be split into zones depending on the sensitivity of the information
* Access to these zones can be gated and guarded
* Assets within these zone would be placed in cabinets that are again secured via lock and key

<<<
== Technical Security
Now that we have addressed the physical security aspects Once inside the computer room, this is where information security starts to take shape.  All the computers in the computer room will need to be accessed by the users.  People with different levels of access would be physically separated into specific areas.  For instance Super users were in a different physical space than regular users.

With the advent of networking,TCP/IP, and better access control mechanisms in operating systems that requirement to physically segregate users started to diminish.

That requirement to physically segregate users with different levels of access via gates and guards moved to the network and operating system level and this is where information security started to take a foot hold.

Applications that operated on top of the operating system implemented fine grained access mechanisms for the users.

The gates and guards started getting replaced by electronic locks with pin pads and cameras.  Whereby to prove that you were authorized to access an area, you would have the PIN to the door which you would use to get access.  

The PIN pads later got replaced by card access, where you had to scan your card to enter an area.

As you can see a lot of Physical Security controls are also moving into information security space whereby the cameras that are recording and the recording management software, the card access system and access management are all managed by applications that are operating on top of an operating system running on a computer system.

Enter Information Security, which at the most fundamental level is the basis for:

* Information Technology Security
* System Security
**  Network Security
**  Application Security
*** Database Security
* Cyber Security

This book will cover the various aspects of implementing an Information Security Program at an organization of any size. You don't have to be a huge organization to have an information security program.  If you are in business you are collecting, storing, and transmitting all kinds of information and it important that you know how to ensure that information is protected at all times.  If it is not then maybe your business might be at risk.

<<<
== Information Security Program

image::InformationSecurityProgram.png[]

=== Security Policy
Before any solution is implemented, a security policy must be created to ensure all the industry, regulatory,  and other compliance requirements are documented.  This document will provide the security requirements to ensure the deployment is secure. All the requirements should be very high level without delving into implementation details.

=== Security Metrics
To ensure the success of a information security program, following metrics should be tracked over at least a year.

Most Important ones at the top

* Asset Count
** Access Points
** Cameras
** Domains
** Sub-domains
** Servers
** Laptops
** Desktops
** Switches
** Routers
** Firewalls
** Printers
* AD Asset Counts
** User accounts
** Application Accounts
** Computer Accounts
** Groups
** Mailboxes
* Patching
** OS Patching
** Application Patching
* Active Threat Metrics
** Mean Time To Detect Threats
** Mean Time To Respond To Threats
** Malware Blocked
** Malware Allowed
** Phishing Blocked
** Phishing Allowed
** DDOS Attacks Prevented

=== Security Manual
This document goes into details on the how the security policy requirements must be implemented.  It can be one document, or multiple depending on the size of implementation.

<<<
=== Security Standards
Standards are mandatory requirements that must be adhered to. Some of the standards to be considered are:

==== Windows Web Server Hardening

=== Security Guidelines



<<<
== Organizational Structure
You can have the best security organization, however, if you do not have security embedded in Project Delivery, Vendor Management, Change Management, and Operations then it becomes to enforce security.


<<<	
=== Security Organization
For Security to be taken seriously a security organization is mandatory, while the non operational team would report to the CISO, the operational structure can be based on two models:

* Centralized
* Distributed

In centralized operational model, all aspects of security operations are within the security organization, such as:

* User provisioning/de-provisioning
* Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)
* Security Operations Center
* Incident Response
* Firewall & Network Operations

In a decentralized operations model, the above aspects are managed by different business units with the security organization providing oversight in form of GRC.

==== Security Operations
A robust mechanism must be instituted to ensure all systems are baselined and any deviation from the baseline is reported to the SOC  for action.
All critical components must be monitored at all times, and SIEM   leveraged to discover anomalies and ensure they are addressed in a timely fashion.

=== Code Analysis

==== Microsoft Application Inspector
Microsoft Application Inspector is a software source code analysis tool that helps identify and surface well-known features and other interesting characteristics of source code to aid in determining what the software is or what it does. It has received attention on ZDNet, SecurityWeek, CSOOnline, Linux.com/news, HelpNetSecurity, Twitter and more and was first featured on Microsoft.com.

Application Inspector is different from traditional static analysis tools in that it doesn't attempt to identify "good" or "bad" patterns; it simply reports what it finds against a set of over 400 rule patterns for feature detection including features that impact security such as the use of cryptography and more. This can be extremely helpful in reducing the time needed to determine what Open Source or other components do by examining the source directly rather than trusting to limited documentation or recommendations.

The tool supports scanning various programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Objective-C, Go, Ruby, PowerShell and more and can scan projects with mixed langauge files. It also includes HTML, JSON and text output formats

=== Key Management

<<<
== System Security
All the servers that the distributed ledger platform runs on must be:

. Hardened
. Monitored for availability
. Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Protection mechanisms deployed to protect from attacks coupled with SIEM for proactive defense.
. Based on the security be in a DMZ 

<<<
== Security-as-Code

Process:

. Test the source code
. Test the code's execution
. Test the app's infrastructure
. Test the Infrastructure as Code
. Monitor and protect access to "the app" and its data
. Secure the software factory itself

Policy considerations

. What gets tested? Fail build with critical vulns?
. Who can approve exceptions?
. Frequency of testing
. Are containers and packages scanned?
. Who reviews configurations?
. Are templates required/enforced?
. How is IaC testing and protection incorporated?
. Who reviews/approves?
. Inspecting E-W and N-S traffict/from containers, clusters, and pods
. Separation of duties?
. Common controls

<<<
== Container Security
A container is a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.  It is a portable artifact, easily shared and moved around.  Makes development and deployment more efficient.

Containers are layers of images.  Mostly Linux Base Image, because of small size.  Application goes on top.

=== Container Environment
A container environment consists of components that increase your attack surface.

. Images
.. Keep updated at all times
.. Sign
. Image Registry
.. Private
.. Monitor the registry
.. Registry host server is secure
. Runtime
.. Good application security
.. Monitor network protocols
.. Monitor network payloads
.. Monitor the host
. Orchestration Platforms: manage container lifecycle (Kubernetes, Docker, OCP)
.. Set limits on provileged users
.. Set limits on amounts of privilege you provide
.. Host running the orchestration platform
. Host OS that manages the Docker Daemon and Docker Client
.. Selinux
.. Access control
.. Monitor

=== Container Scanners
DockerBench tests containers
OpenSCAP

=== Container Monitoring
Prometheus

=== Firewall
Cilium

=== Kubernetes
How do I run my workloads securely in Kubernetes to:

. Code frum untrusted registries
. Vulnerabilities in tools of OS or code libraries
. Bloated Base Images

Prevent it by:

. Use approved lean images
. Create list of trusted registires
. Image Scanning
. Do not run containers with root
. Avoid running privileged pods
. Set limits on cluster resources for containers
.. Resource Quota, limits the number of resources or capacity of resources granted
..
. Secure Communication between pods
.. Network Policies
.. Firewalls for Pods
.. Namespaces, keep resources and teams seperate from each other
.. Service Mesh, takes the logic of communication between services from app code to network layer
... mTLS
... Communication Rules
. Securing Secrets Data
.. Do not use as environment vars or hard coded
.. By Default, secret data is stored in plaintext in etcd
... Restrict access to etcd data
... Encrypt etcd backups
... Run & Manage etcd outside the cluster
.. K8s supports encryption at rest
.. Use tools like HashiCorp Vault
. Securing Access to K8s cluster
.. Authentication
... Certificates in Kubernetes
... Client certificates for human users
... Service Accounts for non-human users
. Securing Access t K8s cluster
.. Do not use NodePort
.. LoadBalancer is better
.. Ingress - even better



Prometheus container should not be running as root.




<<<
== Cloud Computing
Cloud has commoditized compute making it very easy to deploy environments at break neck speed.  With this speed comes the need for careful planning of the cloud deployments. Not all workloads are built to be migrated to the cloud.

=== Human Resources
First action every organization has to take is to ensure they have resources who understand how cloud environments are configured. Training is the key.  Configuring on premise infrastructure is quite different from configuring infrastructure in the cloud, it is a total paradigm shift.

=== Security
Since the cloud technology is still evolving, misconfiguration is a given that will happen.  Hence what the organizations have ensure is to embed "by design" principles into their cloud strategy.  A framework has to be established which ensures that as the data moves into the cloud is tagged at the source and those tags are used to ensure it is protected while in use, in transit, and in storage.

Ensure that:

. Your infrastructure teams understand Infrastrucutre As Code (IaC) for the clouds you will be deploying in.
. A process is in place where the IaC templates are reviewed to ensure a security review is conducted to avoid misconfiguration that may expose the data
. The IaC repository is closely monitored for unauthorized changes and its integrity maintained at all times.

=== Architecture
The architecture should be to enable business to ensure time to market is reduced as much as possible when it comes to IT.

Microservices are key, and three microservices that play key role are authentication, authorization, and logging.

=== Cost Management





<<<
== Vulnerability Management Program
Red team-blue team exercises take their name from their military antecedents. The idea is simple: One group of security pros — a red team — attacks something, and an opposing group — the blue team — defends it. Originally, the exercises were used by the military to test force-readiness.

=== Deep vs Dark Web
Dark web is every resource where hackers & criminal underground engage with each other.  Tor is a mechanism that is used as a transport for the dark web.

=== Pastebin

=== Taxonomy
Taxonomy is important as it ensures industry standard terms are used when talking about vulnerabilities, threat actors, and reporting.

==== Attacks

image::TypesOfAttacks.jpg[]

===== Social Engineering Attacks
* *Phishing* The perpatrator send an email or text to the target, seeking valuable information

* *Vishing* The perpatrator makes a fradulent phone calls to the target, seeking valuable information

* *Baiting* Baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victims's curiosity.  They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information.

* *Quid pro quo* The perpatratpr makes random calls to a company's employees offering a service or a benefit in exchange for information or access

* *Pretexting* It is often initiated by a perpatrator pretending to need sensitive information from a victim so as to perform a critical task.  The success rate of this attack heavily depends on the attackers ability to build trust.

* *Watering Hole* The perpetrator injects malicious code into the web pages that the targets visit.  Once a victim visits the page on the compromised website, a backdoor Trojan is installed on thier computer.

==== Malware
A malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of damaging devices, stealing data, and generally causing a mess. Viruses, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware are among the different kinds of malware.

Malware is often created by teams of hackers: usually, they’re just looking to make money, either by spreading the malware themselves or selling it to the highest bidder on the Dark Web. However, there can be other reasons for creating malware too — it can be used as a tool for protest, a way to test security, or even as weapons of war between governments.

image::TypesOfMalware.jpg[]

* *Adware* Though not always malicious in nature, aggressive advertising software can undermine your security just to serve you ads — which can give other malware an easy way in. Plus, let’s face it: pop-ups are really annoying.

* *Bots* Bots is a soft for roBot. Bots are usually controlled remotely and work as a network.

* *Keylogger* It is one of the most dangerous threats to a PC user's privacy. This type of malware installs itself as a result of clicking while browsing the Internet or downloading software. Keyloggers keep track of all of your keystrokes when you are using your PC and then transfers the information to a remote server. It is capable of recording all of your online conversations, emails, and password logins, as well as creating screenshots of all of your PC activity.

Keyloggers are not always in the form of malware or software; it can also be installed on your computer in the form of hardware through being placed between the plug on your keyboard and the entry port. Some keyloggers are legitimate applications such as those that record an employee's PC activity during work hours. Other keyloggers are in the form of malicious software that is designed to perform criminal activity.

* *Ransomware* This kind of malware typically locks down your computer and your files, and threatens to erase everything unless you pay a ransom.

* *Remote Access*

* *Rootkit*

* *Spyware* No surprise here — spyware is malware designed to spy on you. It hides in the background and takes notes on what you do online, including your passwords, credit card numbers, surfing habits, and more.

* *Trojans* This kind of malware disguises itself as legitimate software, or is hidden in legitimate software that has been tampered with. It tends to act discreetly and create backdoors in your security to let other malware in.

* *Virus* Like their biological namesakes, viruses attach themselves to clean files and infect other clean files. They can spread uncontrollably, damaging a system’s core functionality and deleting or corrupting files. They usually appear as an executable file (.exe)

* *Worm* Worms infect entire networks of devices, either local or across the internet, by using network interfaces. It uses each consecutively infected machine to infect others.

=== Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability Assessment is designed to find vulnerabilities and assess to ensure they are not false positives. The next step is to remediate the vulnerability by patching the system, reconfiguring it, or implementing other controls to reduce the risk. 

=== Penetration Testing
Penetration testing, or pen testing for short, is an authorized attack against your computer system to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.  This activity is also known as ethical hacking.  

Penetration testing is a technical control that is implemented to ensure the systems that are currently in production or are going to be production do not have any vulnerabilities that would allow threat vectors to exploit.

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) provides the necessary guidelines on how to conduct penetration testing.  More information can be found here: http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page 

Penetration Testing goes further than vulnerability assessment.  After a vulnerability is identified, the tester attempts to exploit a vulnerability. This can be done numerous ways and, once a vulnerability is exploited, a good tester will not stop. They will continue to find and exploit other vulnerabilities, chaining attacks together, to reach their goal. Each organization is different, so this goal may change, but usually includes access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and trade secrets. Sometimes this requires Domain Administrator access; often it does not or Domain Administrator is not enough.

Penetration testing involves following steps:
. Reconnaissance via open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering techniques.  IT does not involve probing any or your devices, but gathering as much information publicly available about your environment using internet sources. 
. Scanning your network to identify active devices
. Fingerprint active devices to identify operating system and applications installed
. Find vulnerabilities for the services running on your systems
. Exploiting those vulnerabilities
. Once the vulnerability has been exploited, further probing the system to seek valuable information such as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) etc.
. Try to further explore other systems on the network and exploit them if possible.
. Produce a report that identifies vulnerabilities, which ones were exploited, what was the outcome of exploitation and suggest high level remediation steps.

There are three approaches to Penetration Tests:
. Black Box: No knowledge of th infrastructure.
. White Box: Full knowledge of the infrastructure.
. Grey Box: Some knowledge of the infrastructure.

Penetration Tests can include following scopes:
. External
. Internal
. Web application
. Wireless
. Cloud
. Social

I have created a seperate document listing some of the https://github.com/secunoid/InformationSecurity/blob/master/PenetrationTestingTools.adoc[Penetration Testing Tools] that we have used.


==== Red team Assessment
A Red Team Assessment is similar to a penetration test in many ways but is more targeted. The goal of the Red Team Assessment is NOT to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. The goal is to test the organization's detection and response capabilities. The red team will try to get in and access sensitive information in any way possible, as quietly as possible. The Red Team Assessment emulates a malicious actor targeting attacks and looking to avoid detection, similar to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). (Ugh! I said it…) Red Team Assessments are also normally longer in duration than Penetration Tests. A Penetration Test often takes place over 1-2 weeks, whereas a Red Team Assessment could be over 3-4 weeks or longer, and often consists of multiple people.

A Red Team Assessment does not look for multiple vulnerabilities but for those vulnerabilities that will achieve their goals. The goals are often the same as the Penetration Test. Methods used during a Red Team Assessment include Social Engineering (Physical and Electronic), Wireless, External, and more. A Red Team Assessment is NOT for everyone though and should be performed by organizations with mature security programs. These are organizations that often have penetration tests done, have patched most vulnerabilities, and have generally positive penetration test results.

The Red Team Assessment might consist of the following:

A member of the Red Team poses as a Fed-Ex delivery driver and accesses the building. Once inside, the Team member plants a device on the network for easy remote access. This device tunnels out using a common port allowed outbound, such as port 80, 443, or 53 (HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS), and establishes a command and control (C2) channel to the Red Team's servers. Another Team member picks up the C2 channel and pivots around the network, possibly using insecure printers or other devices that will take the sights off the device placed. The Team members then pivot around the network until they reach their goal, taking their time to avoid detection.

This is just one of innumerable methods a Red Team may operate but is a good example of some tests we have performed.

=== Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized – all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers the questions “Where are the high-value assets?” “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?” “What are the most relevant threats?” “Is there an attack vector that might go unnoticed?

It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.

==== Threat Scoring and Databases

===== CVSS
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which provides a score to indicate the severity of the CVE vulnerabilities.

Assignment of a CVSS score is based on:

* The primary impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the protected system/resources
* The derivative impact on loss of life and/or properties
* The percentage of the impacted area within the total environment
* How easy it is to exploit the vulnerability
* How easy it is to remediate the vulnerability
* How confident the testing team is about the existence of the vulnerability

===== NVD
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. NVD also provides severity rankings of "Low," "Medium," and "High" in addition to the numeric CVSS scores. These qualitative rankings are simply mapped from the numeric CVSS scores:

* Vulnerabilities are labeled "Low" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 0.0-3.9.
* Vulnerabilities will be labeled "Medium" severity if they have a base CVSS score of 4.0-6.9.
* Vulnerabilities will be labeled "High" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 7.0-10.0

==== STRIDE
STRIDE is a model of threats developed by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohnfelder at Microsoft[1] for identifying computer security threats.[2] It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.[3]

The threats are:

* **S**poofing of user identity
* **T**ampering
* **R**epudiation
* **I**nformation disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
* **D**enial of service (D.o.S)
* **E**levation of privilege.

==== DREAD
DREAD methodology is used to rate, compare and prioritize the severity of risk presented by each threat that is classified using STRIDE.

* **D**amage
* **R**eproducibility
* **E**xploitability
* **A**ffected Users
* **D**iscoverability

DREAD Risk = (Damage + Reproduciblity + Exploitability + Affected Users + Discoverability) / 5. Calculation always produces a number between 0 and 10. Higher the number means more serious the risk is.

Following is a customized mathematical approach to implement DREAD methodology:-

*Damage Potential*
If a threat exploit occurs, how much damage will be caused?

* 0 = Nothing
* 5 = Information disclosure that could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities
* 8 = Individual/employer non sensitive user data is compromised.
* 9 = Administrative non sensitive data is compromised.
* 10 = Complete system or data destruction.
* 10 = Application unavailability.

*Reproducible*
How easy is it to reproduce the threat exploit?

* 0 = Very hard or impossible, even for administrators of the application.
* 5 = Complex steps are required for authorized user.
* 7.5 = Easy steps for Authenticated user
* 10 = Just a web browser and the address bar is sufficient, without authentication.

*Exploit-ability*
What is needed to exploit this threat?

* 2.5 = Advanced programming and networking knowledge, with custom or advanced attack tools.
* 5 = Exploit exits in public, using available attack tools.
* 9 = A Web Application Proxy tool
* 10 = Just a web browser

*Affected Users*
How many users will be affected?

* 0 = None
* 2.5 individual/employer that is already compromised.
* 6 = some users of individual or employer privileges, but not all.
* 8 = Administrative users
* 10 = All users

*Discover-ability*
How easy is it to discover this threat?

* 0 = Very hard requires source code or administrative access.
* 5 = Can figure it out by monitoring and manipulating HTTP requests
* 8 = Details of faults like this are already in the public domain and can be easily discovered using a search engine.
* 10 = the information is visible in the web browser address bar or in a form.

DREAD methodology can be customized to cater the needs of your application, during consultancy engagements it should be approved from the client before starting the security assessment so that after you perform the analysis the results produced by DREAD couldn’t be challenged.

=== Threat Intelligence
This is the key methodology that every cyber security practictioner should be familiar with.  It ensures that one stays in sync with all the activites of threat actors and use that information to proactively protect their environments.

==== STIX
STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) was originally conceived as a language to describe cyber threat intelligence. This was groundbreaking at the time because it was the first language to provide a definition of cyber threat intelligence. Although it’s a bit of a fuzzy term, cyber threat intelligence generally describes information about adversaries and their behaviors that can inform defensive actions. For example, knowing that a certain adversary targets financial institutions by using specially crafted spear-phishing emails, and then delivers Trojans that will reach out to a certain set of websites that are known to be malicious, can be very helpful in defending against the attack. STIX captures that type of intelligence in a machine-readable form so that it can be shared among organizations and tools.

The DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communications funded MITRE, beginning in 2012, to act as the technical developer of STIX and serve as a community facilitator to jumpstart STIX. Once some level of maturity was reached, STIX would be transitioned to an international standards body. That goal was realized in 2015 when governance of STIX was transitioned to OASIS, an international standards consortium. This was a big step for STIX and a big success for DHS, MITRE, and the community because it meant that STIX was on its way to becoming an international standard. Although DHS and MITRE continue to serve in several leadership positions in the CTI TC, the majority of the leadership and the vast majority of participants in the TC are from industry. In fact, the OASIS CTI TC was founded with more participants than any other TC in OASIS history. It's that community that led the development of STIX 2.0.

==== TAXII
TAXII is a high-level protocol for moving cyber threat intelligence (primarily STIX) data around between systems and tools. We expect that, within the coming months, TAXII will be achieving this same milestone and opening its own public review period.

=== Threat Risk Assessments
*Threat*: Any potential actor that has the capability, motivation, or intent to exploit a vulnerability.
Vulnerability: Is a weakness that allows a threat to compromise the security of a system.

*Risk*: Likelihood of a threat source to exploit a vulnerability to target a critical asset and impact a business negatively.
Controls, safeguards, countermeasures are implemented to reduce the risk.

== Digital Forensics & Incident Response

=== Preparation
. Know your tools, practise, practise, practise
. Have procedures on when and how to use your tools
. There are differences on how to respond to an incident based on based on environment, hence ensure you are familiar with the environment and know which tools to use.  You should have a playbook for each environment. Some to of environments are:
.. On Premise
.. Azure
.. GCP
.. AWS
.. Other cloud provider

=== During the Incident
. Secure the impacted environment to ensure no one but Incident Responders only
. Document every activity during the incident in a log to ensure you have a timeline
. Dump the memory using following tools(this is not an exhaustive list):
.. PMEM
.. FTKIMAGER
. Decide which logs do you need to conduct your analysis, for example:
.. Active Directory Logs if you are an AD Shop, 99% environments today are.
.. File Server Logs
.. Web Server Logs
.. Application Server Logs
.. Database Server Logs
.. Firewall Logs
.. Switch Logs
.. Router Logs
.. Access Point Logs

=== Playbooks

==== Windows Persistence
Focus on System & Security logs.  Standard artifact utilized in any investigation.

Following log types are important:

. Task logs 
. Events concerning services
.. 7045 - Code for new service installed, should be a low frequency event.
.. 7009 - Service failed to start, what should be running and is not.
.. 7035/7036 - Services being tampered with for malicious purposes. Look for services that have no descrption, and have image path that is in a non standard directory.  DLL is in the same directory as exe, which is a side loading technique. Check for start type, if it is changed to 2, which is auto start. Type 10 means that the service is running under user account authority.
.. 601 - Attempt to install a service
.. 7034 - Service has crashed unexpectedly
. Events concerning schedules tasks
.. 4698 - When a scheduled task is created on a system that has been compromised
.. 4702 - When a scheduled task has been altered
.. 4701/4699 
.. 4700 - A scheduled task has been enabled.

Scheduled tasks with abnormal names or directories.  Attackers usually create a verly long task name.  Check the command syntax.

== Enterprise Architecture
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUD-LXUE4tM 

*Enterprise* is any organization that is large or small with a collaborative collection of sub-organizations with a shared set of objectives.

*Architecture* is a designed structure of something.  A description of the structure (components) and behaviors (Processes) of a system.  It is also an activity required to produce such a description.

*Enterprise Architecture* is documentation describing the structure and behaviour of an enterprise including its information systems.  Also a process for describing an enterprise(including its information systems), then planning and governing changes to improve the integrity and flexibility of the enterprise.

Frameworks provide guidelines on how to implement enterprise architecture.  Frameworks address following areas:
* Content (strcuture, metamodel)
* Process (activities)
* Organization (roles, people)

Some of the frameworks are:

* TOGAF (covers all three, content, process, and organization)
* Zachman (Purely covers content)
* SABSA
* DODAF
* MODAF

Large organizations are complex, hence they can be broken down into following typical domains

. Business (Why organization exisit, objectives, goals, strategic thinking, capabilities, processes, functions, organizatinal structure)
. Data
. Application(s)
. Technology

Following domains cut across the typical domains:

. Security
. Compliance


*Architecture Activities* typically when you are performing any sort of change, you have to document the current state and future state.  This represents the strategic vision of the organization, where they want to be in 3-5 years time.

Enterprise architecture is about overseeing these changes by defining various architecture principles and standards.  Architects then govern those changes to ensure that the standards and principles are being followed.

=== SABSA
SABSA is a framework that supports the business in reaching its goals.  It is the leading methodology for developing business operational risk-based architectures.  SABSA stands for Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture.

It provides a framework for developing risk driven enterprise information security and information assurance architectures.

It also helps to deliver security infrastructure solutions that help critical business initiatives.

The SABSA methodology provides guidance for aligning architecture with business value, it also addresses a critical need for greater integration between security and enterprise architecture within organizations.

With SABASA organizations can achieve that important risk reward balance using a range of frameworks, models, methods, and process to manage risk and measure performance.

The SABSA model is the key to this and covers the whole lifecycle of operational capabilities.  The SABSA model has six layers:

. Contextual Architecture: The Business View (Business wisdom and business decision making)
. Conceptual Architecture: The Architect's vision (The 'big picture', business attributes profiel and risk objectives)
. Logical Architecture: The Designers Vision (Information, services, processes, applications)
. Physical Architecture: The builders/constructors view(Data mechanisms, infrastructure, platforms)
. Component Architecture: The Trademan's View (Products, Tools, Specific Standards, Technologies)
. Security Services Management Architecture: The Service Manager's view (Service management activities, processes and monitoring)

Each of the layers of the architecture model are supported by a vertical analysis based on six key questions

* What
* Why
* How
* Who
* Where
* When

The SABSA framework is flexible, scalable and applicable to any industry sector.  Instead of replacing other risk based standards, it can be combined with TOGAF, COBIT and ITIL to create an integrated compliance framework.

SABSA provides organization with "enterprise operational risk management architecture" that can be completely tailored to a specific business model. 

SABSA's governance model provide a control feedback loop

== Information Security  Frameworks

=== NIST Cyber Security Framework(CSF)

Key functions are

Identify:: involves determining your IT risks and securing the necessary budget and resources to defend your digital resources. Your decisions should be based on the contextualized threat intelligence you collect. In addition to assessing internal IT risk, this goal should include analyzing the security competence of third-party vendors and any customers with which you exchange data. It’s critical to identify those that represent an elevated risk to your organization’s systems and data. It’s also important to bring in threat intelligence on the risks your competitors face because you likely face similar threats.

Protect:: is about deploying the required security controls (technologies and processes) to defend your digital assets, and then validating that these controls align to the risks you identified. For example, controls should be applied to set up defenses against exploit kits, as well as undisclosed zero-day and embargoed vulnerabilities, as identified by your threat intelligence platform. You also need to safeguard against the exploitation of high-risk vulnerabilities in your technology stack.

Detect:: revolves around your ability to block attacks before they impact digital assets. Threat intelligence helps by enabling you to identify and research the evolution and trends of malware families with high risk to your organization. In addition to identifying the security patches to apply, you will also gain intelligence on which systems are most susceptible and which are being actively targeted and exploited.

Respond:: refers to how fast your security team reacts to breaches; even the strongest security postures do not offer a 100% guarantee that cyberattacks will not succeed. Threat intelligence assists in the response process by evaluating the data exposure and the digital asset damage your organization is facing. This can then be reported to all affected parties and stakeholders — not only for remediation teams, but also for non-technical personnel who may need to prepare for the impact on day-to-day operations and the potential impact on vendors, clients, and perhaps even the overall market in which you operate.

Recover:: is all about how quickly the damage inflicted upon the organization’s technology stack and surrounding ecosystem can be mitigated, including any and all operations that must be restored as the security incidents are being closed out. Threat intelligence helps pinpoint the specific measures the security team should take in order to quarantine infected systems and inoculate the malicious elements coursing through the environment. The ultimate goal in the case of a breach, of course, is to quickly and safely restore the digital assets back to fully functioning systems with all security measures intact.

Top two are proactive measures, and bottom three are reactive measures.

== Governance, Risk, & Compliance

A documented process must be followed to ensure compliance to https://github.com/secunoid/InformationSecurity/blob/master/Information%20Security%20-%20A%20Comprehensive%20Reference.adoc#74-security-policy/[information security policy] and to highlight risks that might be introduced when the requirements are not adhered to.  Some of the GRC functions are:

* Enterprise Risk Management
* IT Risk Management
* Integrated Risk Management
* Operational Risk Management
* Enterprise GRC Management
* Vendor/Third-Party Risk Management
* Business Continuity
* Financial Audit
* Compliance

=== Lines of Defence
In 2013 The Institute of Internal Auditors released a position paper titled https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/Public%20Documents/PP%20The%20Three%20Lines%20of%20Defense%20in%20Effective%20Risk%20Management%20and%20Control.pdf/[The Three Lines of Defence In Effective Risk Management and Contol].  This paper highlighted how an organization can manage risk and how the risk gaps can be captured across the orgnization just in case it was missed at the front lines.

If the frontline/operational teams miss it, then governance teams can pick it up, and if governance teams miss it then internal audit will catch that.  After internal audit it is the regulators.

In a mature organization, 80% of the risks are handled by the frontline/operational teams, leaving little for governance and internal audit teams to identify.

image::TheThreeLinesOfDefenseModel.png[]

=== Enterprise Risk Management

* Not necessarily covered by insurance
* Multi-dimensional assessment
* Analyzes material risks and how they relate
* Spans the entire organization ("holistic")
* Proactive & continuous
* Considers both upside and downside
* Focuses on business goals, adding value and more
* Embedded in culture and mindset 

=== IT Risk Management

=== Integrated Risk Management

=== Opertional Risk Management

The top operational risks in banking include:
	
* Cybersecurity risks: Even as financial institutions ramp up their cybersecurity efforts, cyber risks, including ransomware and phishing, have become more frequent and more effective, posing a major risk to financial institutions. 
* Third-party risk: Increasingly, financial institutions are relying on third-party providers, which means they have to thoroughly identify, evaluate, and control third-party risks throughout the lifecycle of their relationships with those companies. However, financial institutions also have to identify and evaluate the risks associated with the vendors, suppliers, and contractors that their third-party vendors use. 
* Internal fraud: Losses from fraud inside a financial institution can stem from misappropriation of assets, forgery, tax non-compliance, bribes, and theft.
* External fraud: Fraud committed by third parties includes check fraud, theft, hacking, breaching system security, and data theft.
* Business disruption and systems failures: Hardware or software system failures, power failures, and disruption in telecommunications can interrupt the financial institution’s business operations and cause financial loss.

Operational risk management, which entails incorporating operational risk management practices into a financial institution’s systems, processes, and culture, should be at the center of a financial institution’s operations. Operational risk management is an ongoing process that involves risk assessment, risk decision making, and adopting internal controls to help financial institutions mitigate or avoid risk.

== Leadership
Having the right leadership at every level is key to the success of an organization.  This starts all the way from the top.  Leading a team is just like tending to a garden, that needs constant grooming, support and care.  It is this capability that helps the leader identify any issues and correct them before they get out of control.

Building high performing teams entirely depends on the leader.  The leader must understand they they have to deliverables are and then build their team based on business requriements to ensure alignment with business.

One, is that the leader hires team members who are domian experts and also have experience developing high performing teams.

Two, is that the leader is also a domain expert and is willing to groom and coach team members into the role they need to be in.

In each case leader is they key, they should know enough about business and domains to lead and coach the teams.

=== Leader vs Manager
A manager typically ensures tasks are assigned and delivered on time.  A leader on the other hand is someone who provides direction to the organization and the team.  A Leader invests time and energy in grooming and coaching their team members to be successful in their career at the current organization and also in their future endavours.

=== Why do team members leave?
Here are some of the reasons that might cause team members to leave an organization.

==== Not cultivating the team member
Giving someone a title does not mean that they know exactly what is required.  To set the team member(s) for success the leader has to understand which key ingredients the team member is missing to fulfill the role.  Then come up with a plan to to coach them to build and/or strengthen those capabilities and slowly move them into higher roles.

Inexperienced leaders often make this mistake of promoting a team member to a role without any coaching and skillset development.  Nine out of ten times, the leader has pretty much set the team member for failure and this also becomes the cause of stress and anxiety for the team member.  The team member ends up in meeting where they are expected for deliverables which they have never produced and have no idea on how to produce them.  Since the leader themselves are inexperienced they have no way of salvaging the situation either.

Eventually team members start looking for ways out of the team or the organization.

==== Not listening to experienced team members
Following are the situations when a leader does not listen to an experience team member: 

* Afraid of leading and bringing about the change, do not want to rock the boat
* Are incapable of visualizing the big picture as they lack the knowledge and experience
* Are in the wrong role, hence the hesitation
* Don't have a vision
* Don't have a strategy
* Don't have the self-confidence

==== Teams are not aligned with the organizational goals
It is the leaders role to ensure team members are engaged.  Engagement is brought about when the leader: 

* Ensures that the team is aware of the organizational goals and
* Has put forth a plan for the team to execute upon
* Engages with the team to track the progress and make changes as required
* Ensures that their immediate teams, if they are managing multiple teams, are aware of of each other's goals and deliverables

=== Important qualities of a leader 
Following are some of the qualities a leader should have: 

* Domain Expert, which means the leader is able to: 
** Set vision/goals for the team
** Provide career advise to team members
** Coach and train team members and set them up for success at the current organization and for their future
** Roll up the sleeves and work with the team
** Provide direction to the team
** Leverage their past exeprience
* Understand the difference between Managing People vs Leading People
* Good listener
* Familiar with Project delivery methodologies

<<<
== Project Management Office (PMO)
PMO sets standards for how projects are managed and to monitor their progress.

* Define standards and rules for project management
* Monitor and approve projects
* Improve the success rate of projects
* Provide training around project management methodologies and standards
* Create relevant documentation and templates

Reasons for having a PMO:

* Ensure compliance with business strategy. The reason why companies run projects is because they need to innovate. They must constantly create new products or services so they won’t end up as the next Kodak. Once you understand this, you understand why having projects succeed is so important. A PMO can act as a watchdog for ensuring projects actually deliver business value.
* Improve overall project success rate. If many of the projects in your company fail, exceed their budget or get delayed, then that’s a good reason for having a PMO.
* Set common standards. If every department has their own set of templates and follows their own project methodology, this can make it hard for cross-functional projects to succeed. A PMO can define common standards that departments have to follow.
* Security, Compliance, and Industry requirements are considered.

There are key roles every project needs, and PMO has to ensure that those roles exist in the organization.

=== Organizational Structure
Following organizational structures have been put togther for illustrative purposes, and can be modified as long as the segegration of duty and deliverables are maintained.

==== Centralized

=== Project Governance
To ensure the project meets is deliverables, timelines, and budget, it has to have checkpoints at different intervals to ensure all the stakeholders are on the same page.  The sub-sections below will outline "suggested" checkpoints for you to consider.

image::ProjectGovernance.png[]

==== Meeting Minutes
It goes without saying how important minutes for each of these meetings are to ensure all the decisions were documented and action items logged and assigned to named individuals.

==== Gates
"Gates" are checkpoints where two distinct teams should be reviewing the projects.  

===== Technical Review
A technical review board should be established that conducts the review of the solution from Gates 1 through 4.  This review ensures projects' adherence strategic plan and blueprints for: 

* Business Requirements
* Enterprise Architecture
** Business Architecture
** Application Architecture
** Data Architecture
** Technology/Infrastructure Architecture
* Security Architecture
* Compliance  
 
===== Financial Review
Financial Reivew is ususally conducted by the Finance to who is providing funding to the project.  Funding is released at specific deliverable milestones.  Most organizations align these reviews to the Technical Reviews whereby after the technical reivew is compelte, i.e. the criteria for that specific gate has been met then the project is cleared to request funding for the next Gate of the project.  The Finance team can review following criteria:

* Estimates vs Actuals
* Capital Burn Rate
* Depending on the project performance and timelines decide how much to fund this initiative

==== Steering Committee Meetings
Also called Steerco meetings are held with project sponsors and key stakeholders at senior level where identified project risks are discussed and their treatment discussed.

==== Internal Team Meetings
These meetings are held with technical and business stakeholders in the organizatino, who are responsible for delivering work packages.  These meetings are usually held weekly to ensure project deliverables, timelines, and budget are tracked and project risks identified.  These risks are then shared with the steerco for further decisioning.

==== Weekly Internal/External Team Meetings
These meetings are held with external entities who are part of the project delivery, select techincal and business lead should attend this meeting to land on overall solution deliverables.  Depending on the complexity of the project, they can be held weekly or as required by the internal project teams.


=== Implementation Plan
The organizational structure and methodology that has been proposed above is the "Lean" way to get "started", what I may call quick and dirty.

. Keep it simple, do not overwhelm the business with too much information, advise them of the end goal and provide assurances that you will manage the complexity of this implementation.  
. The whole implementation could take years, however implement changes in phases to ensure organization is not overwhelmed by the changes.
. In absence of the establishment of the required org structure, document a plan on how to start using the new methodology
. Start creating Templates for: 
.. Project Charter
.. Project Change Requests
.. Meeting Minutes
.. Issues and Actions register
.. Financial Reporting
.. Financial Expenses Tracking
.. Implementation Plans/MOP's
. Create Job Aids and Samples
. Create Checklists
. Governance Processes

== Business Resilience
For a business to be sustainable it has to be able to bear any hardship it faces.  These hardships or risks can be financial, environmental, labor, suppliers, intellectual property , and technical.  Hence every business has to ensure it has documented plans on how to address the risks and become resilient.

In order for a business to be resilient, it has to ensure it follows Business Continuity Management(BCM) strategies and methodologies. BCM itself can be split into two general areas Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.

=== Business Continuity
Some of the strategies and methodologies that a business implements are directly associated to 

==== Conference Call Guidelines
. Use a pre-conferencing/green room/waiting room (This is already configured for Teams Meetings)
. Don't re-use conference access codes (This is already configured for Teams Meetings)
. Don't record the meeting unless necessary
. Do a role call to ensure only invited attendees are on the call
. Before sharing your screen ensure you close all confidential files/applications
. If it is a sensitive meeting, and you record it, ensure the recording is encrypted and stored in a location with limited user access
. If the recording is saved on the web platform ensure you download the recording and delete it from the web platform

*References*
. NIST Guidance: https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/17/Conference%20Call%20Security%20Graphic.pdf

==== Remote Working Guidelines
*Employees*

. Greet your team members using TEAMS chat feature
. Use camera when in meetings
. When in doubt call the team member
. Keep the team connected using Teams Chat and other means as per team norms.
. Over communicate
. Lock your computer when you walk away from your computer  (Windows Key + L)
. Inform you team if you are going to be away from your computer for an extended period
. Avoid multitasking

*Leader*

. Establish team norms:
.. Do we meet more frequently as a team? When? How long?
.. If we use an online meeting platform, does everyone turn on their video camera?
.. How do we ensure people are present and not multitasking?
.. What is the recommended response time to a text or email? Should we use the phone more?
.. How will we share sensitive information? Email? 
. Ensure your team knows what is the best method to contact you
. Conduct Morning Huddles
. Frequent Check-ins
. Use Teams to share for quick feedback

=== Disaster Recovery

<<<
== Online Protection
The purpose of the internet was to connect networks for information sharing.  However, the marketers and service providers have embraced it.

=== Marketing Organizations
Marketing organizations offer free services to get access to your information such as:
 
* Age
* Gender
* Income
* Home address
* Shopping preferences
* Personal interests
* etc.

This helps them target ads to lure you into making impulse purchases.  By offering you free services, the marketing companies such as Google, Facebook, and others are after your personal information, which they sell to organizations to target their products and services to you.

=== Service Providers
All organizations who traditionally had brick and mortar presence are moving to online presence.  When you start engaging with these business online you need to have a way to identify yourself, which is usually via a userid and password.  Depending on the information these organizations hold about you, if your userid and password get compromised this could have negative consequences on you.

=== What should I do to protect myself online?
It is key that we practise good hygiene when using online services:

* Use a password that is at least 13 characters long.  If the site allows, try to use a passphrase instead, such as "My cat does not chase mice!95"
* Use a password manager to store your passwords this avoids the urge to write passwords on paper/yellow sticky notes.
* No passwords can be same
* Enable Multifactor Authentication where possible
* Ensure you are using the latest versins of all software on your computers
* When re-cycling or selling your electronic device make sure you factory reset it so that none of your information stays on it.
* Think before you click on links.
* Only open emails from people you know
* Ensure you are using the latest version of the operating systems on all your devices.
** Windows Computers: Latest version of Windows10 and associated patches
** Apple Mac Computers: Latest version of Mac OS
** Apple iPad: : Latest version of iOS
** Apple iPhones: Latest versino of iOS
** Apple Watch: Latest version of WatchOS
** Android Phones: Latest version of Android OS

. The Get-PSProvider cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell providers in the current session. You can get a particular drive or all drives in the session. Windows PowerShell providers let you access a variety of data stores as though they were file system drives. The Get-PSDrive cmdlet gets the drives in the current session. You can get a particular drive or all drives in the session. This cmdlet gets the following types of drives:
.. Windows logical drives on the computer, including drives mapped to network shares.
.. Drives exposed by Windows PowerShell providers (such as the Certificate:, Function:, and Alias: drives) and the HKLM: and HKCU: drives that are exposed by the Windows PowerShell Registry provider.
.. Session-specified temporary drives and persistent mapped network drives that you create by using the New-PSDrive cmdlet.
Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the Persist parameter of the New-PSDrive cmdlet can create mapped network drives that are saved on the local computer and are available in other sessions. For more information, see New-PSDrive. Also, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, when an external drive is connected to the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically adds a PSDrive to the file system that represents the new drive. You do not need to restart Windows PowerShell. Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically deletes the PSDrive that represents the removed drive.
