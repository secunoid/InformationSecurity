== Introduction
My notes javascript training


Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node is a runtime or environment. It is not a framework.

== Variables
. Variable names can start with uppercase alphabets a through z, $, and underscore(_) only. After the first character you can use numbers.
. Variable names cannot be reserved.

=== Declaring Variables
. `Let` can be re-assigned
. `Const` [red]#cannot# be re-asigned.
. `Var` should be avoided as it has been depricated. When using `var` , JavaScript does not warn the user that the variable has been reassigned causing confusion. `Var` is function scoped, not block scoped.
. Without `let` or `const` the variable can be re-assigned

`let` and `const` helps us describe what a variable is supposed to do and makes the code more readable, it is a matter of semantics.

== Arrays
. arrayname.pop() to remove an item, if () has no value then the last item in the array is removed.
. arrayname.push('some data') to add a new item to the bottom of the array
. arrayname.shift() to remove an item from the top of the array
. arrayname.unshift('some data') to add data to the top of the array
. arrayname.splice(start, item number from start, 'some data')

=== forEach
Used to loop through the array top to bottom. arrayname.forEach(function (item, index) {})

=== Callbacks
Passing function into a function, is also called a callback.


== Strings
For strings you can use:
. Single quotes `'`
. Double quotes `"`
. Backtick ```` 

=== Template Strings
For creating template string were you want to display the contents of a variable you can use it as such:

[source,js,numbered]
Console.log(`This the latest ${variableName}`}

== Data Structures
. String
. Number
.. Infinity
.. NaN (Not a number)
. Boolean
.. true
.. false
. Structure

== Type Conversions
. ToString
. ToNumber
. 

== Conditional Operators
. if statement
.. if 
.. else
.. elsif
. Ternary: Allows us to implement logic in your code without an _if_ statement.
[source,js,numbered]
var a=5
var b=2
if (a<b) {
result = '1';
} else {
result ="2";
}

becomes
[source,js,numbered]
var a=5
var b=2
var result = a< b ? "1" : "2"


== Truthy & Falsy
Truthy: Values that resolve to true in boolean context
Falsy: Values that resolve to false in boolean context. Falsy values - false, 0, empty string, null, undefined, and NaN. Anything that is not in this list will be Truthy.

== Type coercion
There are three values you can coerce to, string, number, and boolean.
[source,js,numbered]
console.log('5'+5)                                              <1>
console.log('5'-5)                                              <2>
console.log('5' === 5)                                          <3>

<1> Outputs 55 as there is a string operator, +,  where you concatenate two strings
<2> Outputs 0 as there is no string operator, -, hence it becomes a number and a subtraction math operator is performed.
<3> Always use , ====, as it matches exactly.  Never use , == .

== typeof & throw
Type checking that input is checked before it is used in a function.

[source,js,numbered]
const getTip = (amount) => {
    if (typeof amount === 'number') {
        return amount * 0.25
    } else {
        throw Error('Argument must be a number')
    }
}
const result = getTip(2)
console.log(result)

== Try & catch
Used to recover gracefully from errors.

== Strict Mode


== Functions
Functions are little sub-programs that you can run over and over.
There are three parts to a function, input, code, and output(also known as a return value). 

[source,js,numbered]
let hey = function() {                                              #<1>
    console.log('Hello');
}
hey()                                                               #<2>

<1> Use `function` keyword
<2> Call the function

=== Scopes
. *Lexical scope* also known as static scope
. *Global scope* defined outside of all the code blocks
. *Local scope* defined inside a code block

=== Types
. *Undefined*: When you create a variable `let blah` and dont assign it a value as in `let blah='blah'` javascript will display an error message `undefined`. When we see `undefined`, it is a language default.
. *Null*: When we see `null` it means the value was _explictly_ cleared by the developer.

== Objects
Objects are essential to development in javascript.  An object allows us to store related pieces of information in a single, central location.
[source,js,numbered]
let myBook = {
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell',
    pageCount: 326
}

=== Methods
A method is an object property whose value is a function.  There are:

. Regular methods
. link:https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String[String methods] 
. link:https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number[Number methods]

== Object Oriented Programming


== Prototypal Inheritance

=== Primitives & Objects
String, number, boolean, null, and undefined are all primitives, and all others are objects.

Object: myObject --> Object.prototype --> null
Array: myArray --> Array.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
Function: myFunc --> Function.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
String: myString --> String.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
Number: myNumber --> Number.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
Boolean: myBoolean --> Boolean.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
