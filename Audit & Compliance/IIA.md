Effective collaboration is vital to ensuring success in compliance!

Earlier this year, the Institute of Internal Auditors revamped its Three Lines of Defense ![[Three Lines Of Defense.png]] Model. The updated version focuses much more on defined roles in an effort to boost collaboration. It encourages the governing body to provide delegation and direction to each line, with the lines providing accountability and reporting in return.

One major change: The model says ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical expectations is now recommended to be a first-line role (for management), a change from compliance's second-line status in the old model.
