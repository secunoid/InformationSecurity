== Overview
Everything in this world is centered around information, knowledge, which translates into a generic term _data_.  This data can be about individuals, places, or things.  Regardless of who or what it is about it is important to protect it.

=== Non-living Entities
Data about non living entities when modified leads to mis-information and currently in the digital age our ability to provide the authenticity of that data is very difficult.  If the source is trustworthy, then we deem it authentic, currently there are no mechanisms to ensure that the data has not been modified in between from when the trustworthy source released and to the time it got to you.

=== Living Entities
Data about living entities, especially us humans is very valuable.  With the devices we carry, and use in our daily lives, we are constantly producing data, every hour, every second of our lives. 

<<<
== Privacy
Centralization has very damaging impacts to a users privacy.  Once the user has provided their information to an entity, they are at entities' mercy for data protection.

Certain states want to keep 

Data that is being processed by the solution should care fully considered for:

. Data protection: Based on data classification ensure data is protected in storage and in transit.
. Data retention: Based on regulatory, and industry requirements,  data should be retained for 
. Data access & update: Allow end users ability to access their data and modify it as required.

Governments across the world are responding to the global cybersecurity crisis by creating new regulations that govern the way companies handle and store valuable consumer data. This includes important information such as personal identifications, banking and credit card numbers, and purchase history.

The European Union, in particular, has been a leader in this field. One of its pioneering efforts is the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) what was passed in 2016 and went into effect in Spring 2018. It impacts all companies that do business with European customers, regardless of where the company is located.

The GDPR requires that companies receive consent from consumers before processing data, collect and store data anonymously, and notify customers when their information has potentially been breached. It also requires large businesses to appoint a data privacy protection officer to oversee implementation of the regulations.

Furthermore, while the U.S. federal government has yet to create a set of strong data privacy protections, several states have drawn up their legislation, including Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Washington.

However, the most important of these regulations come from California, the largest state in the country by population with nearly 40 million residents. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and governs the way companies must store and secure data.

CCPA allows consumers to demand crucial information about their personal data held by corporations.

When requested, businesses must inform consumers about the type of personal data they possess, provide them with specific personal information collected in the previous year, and allow customers to request that their information not be shared with third parties. Companies will also have to delete customer data when requested.

== Data Protection

=== Methodology
. Define what to classify
. Define where to classify
. Define who applies classification
. Define conditions
. Assign labels to users and groups
. Define Access rights
. Create classification policies
. Test Classification policies
. Deploy classification policies
. Monitor and accelerate remediation

=== Know your data
. Where is my sensitive data 
located? 
. What are the risky activities happening in my organization – files shared externally, across 1st and 3rd party apps?
. I need to comply with a new regulation? Where is my PII data located & where is it being generated? 
. How do I control data sprawl and build a strategy for ROT before I bring data
. How do I see activity around classification and labeling across retention and sensitivity labels once they have been used across governance and retention outcomes?
. How do I monitor  ongoing risk around label activity?


=== Password Strength
Brute force password cracking - the importance of using a long password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase and special characters.

Assuming an attacker has a reasonably fast connection and PC, the table is an estimate of the amount of time it would take to generate every possible combination of passwords for a given number of characters. After generating the list it's just a matter of time before the computer runs through all the possibilities – or gets shut down trying.

Pay particular attention to the difference between using only lowercase characters and using all possible characters (uppercase, lowercase, and special characters – like @#$%^&*). Adding just one capital letter and one asterisk would change the processing time for an 8 character password from 2.4 days to 2.1 centuries.

== Information Security 
Information Security as you can infer, all about information protection.  Before the advent of internet information was stored in corporate data centers and they had mechanisms in place to protect the information.  The two main areas that are focused are logical and technical security.

=== Logical Security
Logical controls are about physical aspects of the information protection.  The computer system is housed in a building in a particular area.  Depending on the sensitivity of the information various mechanisms are put in place like:

* Fenced building perimeter
* Gates at the entry and exit points
* Guards manning those gates to ensure that only authorized individuals are allowed through the gates

Now working through the layers just like peeling an onion. You have gone through the first layer the perimeter. Now once in the perimeter it has to be ensured:

* Ensuring protections are in place to prevent vehicles damaging the building via direct impacts
* Split the building into zones with different levels of access levels for the personnel and this can be gated & guarded area
* Ensure computer room is in the middle of the building without any window access
* The computer room can be split into zones depending on the sensitivity of the information
* Access to these zones can be gated and guarded
* Assets within these zone would be placed in cabinets that are again secured via lock and key

=== Technical Security
Now that we have addressed the physical security aspects Once inside the computer room, this is where information security starts to take shape.  All the computers in the computer room will need to be accessed by the users.  People with different levels of access would be physically separated into specific areas.  For instance Super users were in a different physical space than regular users.

With the advent of networking,TCP/IP, and better access control mechanisms in operating systems that requirement to physically segregate users started to diminish.

That requirement to physically segregate users with different levels of access via gates and guards moved to the network and operating system level and this is where information security started to take a foot hold.

Applications that operated on top of the operating system implemented fine grained access mechanisms for the users.

The gates and guards started getting replaced by electronic locks with pin pads and cameras.  Whereby to prove that you were authorized to access an area, you would have the PIN to the door which you would use to get access.  

The PIN pads later got replaced by card access, where you had to scan your card to enter an area.

As you can see a lot of Physical Security controls are also moving into information security space whereby the cameras that are recording and the recording management software, the card access system and access management are all managed by applications that are operating on top of an operating system running on a computer system.

Enter Information Security, which at the most fundamental level is the basis for:

* Information Technology Security
* System Security
**  Network Security
**  Application Security
*** Database Security
* Cyber Security

This book will cover the various aspects of implementing an Information Security Program at an organization of any size. You don't have to be a huge organization to have an information security program.  If you are in business you are collecting, storing, and transmitting all kinds of information and it important that you know how to ensure that information is protected at all times.  If it is not then maybe your business might be at risk.

<<<
== Security Organization
For Security to be taken seriously a security organization is mandatory, while the non operational team would report to the CISO, the operational structure can be based on two models:

. Centralized
. Distributed

In centralized operational model, all aspects of security operations are within the security organization, such as:

. User provisioning/deprovisioning
. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)
. Security Operations Center
. Incident Response
. Firewall & Network Operations

In a decentralized operations model, the above aspects are managed by different business units with the security organization providing oversight in form of GRC.

=== Security Operations
A robust mechanism must be instituted to ensure all systems are baselined and any deviation from the baseline is reported to the SOC  for action.
All critical components must be monitored at all times, and SIEM   leveraged to discover anomalies and ensure they are addressed in a timely fashion.

=== Security Architecture

=== Security Development

=== Security Strategy

<<<

== Security Policy
Before any solution is implemented, a security policy must be created to ensure all the industry, regulatory,  and other compliance requirements are documented.  This document will provide the security requirements to ensure the deployment is secure. All the requirements should be very high level without delving into implementation details.

<<<
== Security Manual
This document goes into details on the how the security policy requirements must be implemented.  It can be one document, or multiple depending on the size of implementation.

<<<
== Security Standards
Standards are mandatory requirements that must be adhered to. Some of the standards to be considered are:

=== Windows Web Server Hardening

=== Code Analysis

==== Microsoft Application Inspector
Microsoft Application Inspector is a software source code analysis tool that helps identify and surface well-known features and other interesting characteristics of source code to aid in determining what the software is or what it does. It has received attention on ZDNet, SecurityWeek, CSOOnline, Linux.com/news, HelpNetSecurity, Twitter and more and was first featured on Microsoft.com.

Application Inspector is different from traditional static analysis tools in that it doesn't attempt to identify "good" or "bad" patterns; it simply reports what it finds against a set of over 400 rule patterns for feature detection including features that impact security such as the use of cryptography and more. This can be extremely helpful in reducing the time needed to determine what Open Source or other components do by examining the source directly rather than trusting to limited documentation or recommendations.

The tool supports scanning various programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Objective-C, Go, Ruby, PowerShell and more and can scan projects with mixed langauge files. It also includes HTML, JSON and text output formats

. Hardened
. Monitored for availability
. Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Protection mechanisms deployed to protect from attacks coupled with SIEM for proactive defense.
. Based on the security be in a DMZ 

<<<
== Vulnerability Management Program
Red team-blue team exercises take their name from their military antecedents. The idea is simple: One group of security pros — a red team — attacks something, and an opposing group — the blue team — defends it. Originally, the exercises were used by the military to test force-readiness.

=== Deep vs Dark Web
Dark web is every resource where hackers & criminal underground engage with each other.  Tor is a mechanism that is used as a transport for the dark web.

=== Taxonomy
Taxonomy is important as it ensures industry standard terms are used when talking about vulnerabilities, threat actors, and reporting.

==== Attacks

image::TypesOfAttacks.jpg[]

==== Malware
A malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of damaging devices, stealing data, and generally causing a mess. Viruses, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware are among the different kinds of malware.

Malware is often created by teams of hackers: usually, they’re just looking to make money, either by spreading the malware themselves or selling it to the highest bidder on the Dark Web. However, there can be other reasons for creating malware too — it can be used as a tool for protest, a way to test security, or even as weapons of war between governments.

image::TypesOfMalware.jpg[]

* *Adware* Though not always malicious in nature, aggressive advertising software can undermine your security just to serve you ads — which can give other malware an easy way in. Plus, let’s face it: pop-ups are really annoying.

* *Bots* Bots is a soft for roBot. Bots are usually controlled remotely and work as a network.

* *Keylogger* It is one of the most dangerous threats to a PC user's privacy. This type of malware installs itself as a result of clicking while browsing the Internet or downloading software. Keyloggers keep track of all of your keystrokes when you are using your PC and then transfers the information to a remote server. It is capable of recording all of your online conversations, emails, and password logins, as well as creating screenshots of all of your PC activity.

Keyloggers are not always in the form of malware or software; it can also be installed on your computer in the form of hardware through being placed between the plug on your keyboard and the entry port. Some keyloggers are legitimate applications such as those that record an employee's PC activity during work hours. Other keyloggers are in the form of malicious software that is designed to perform criminal activity.

* *Ransomware* This kind of malware typically locks down your computer and your files, and threatens to erase everything unless you pay a ransom.

* *Remote Access*

* *Rootkit*

* *Spyware* No surprise here — spyware is malware designed to spy on you. It hides in the background and takes notes on what you do online, including your passwords, credit card numbers, surfing habits, and more.

* *Trojans* This kind of malware disguises itself as legitimate software, or is hidden in legitimate software that has been tampered with. It tends to act discreetly and create backdoors in your security to let other malware in.

* *Virus* Like their biological namesakes, viruses attach themselves to clean files and infect other clean files. They can spread uncontrollably, damaging a system’s core functionality and deleting or corrupting files. They usually appear as an executable file (.exe)

* *Worm* Worms infect entire networks of devices, either local or across the internet, by using network interfaces. It uses each consecutively infected machine to infect others.

=== Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability Assessment is designed to find vulnerabilities and assess to ensure they are not false positives. The next step is to remediate the vulnerability by patching the system, reconfiguring it, or implementing other controls to reduce the risk. 

=== Penetration Testing
Penetration testing, or pen testing for short, is an authorized attack against your computer system to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.  This activity is also known as ethical hacking.  

Penetration testing is a technical control that is implemented to ensure the systems that are currently in production or are going to be production do not have any vulnerabilities that would allow threat vectors to exploit.

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) provides the necessary guidelines on how to conduct penetration testing.  More information can be found here: http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page 

Penetration Testing goes further than vulnerability assessment.  After a vulnerability is identified, the tester attempts to exploit a vulnerability. This can be done numerous ways and, once a vulnerability is exploited, a good tester will not stop. They will continue to find and exploit other vulnerabilities, chaining attacks together, to reach their goal. Each organization is different, so this goal may change, but usually includes access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and trade secrets. Sometimes this requires Domain Administrator access; often it does not or Domain Administrator is not enough.

Penetration testing involves following steps:
. Reconnaissance via open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering techniques.  IT does not involve probing any or your devices, but gathering as much information publicly available about your environment using internet sources. 
. Scanning your network to identify active devices
. Fingerprint active devices to identify operating system and applications installed
. Find vulnerabilities for the services running on your systems
. Exploiting those vulnerabilities
. Once the vulnerability has been exploited, further probing the system to seek valuable information such as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) etc.
. Try to further explore other systems on the network and exploit them if possible.
. Produce a report that identifies vulnerabilities, which ones were exploited, what was the outcome of exploitation and suggest high level remediation steps.

There are three approaches to Penetration Tests:
. Black Box: No knowledge of th infrastructure.
. White Box: Full knowledge of the infrastructure.
. Grey Box: Some knowledge of the infrastructure.

Penetration Tests can include following scopes:
. External
. Internal
. Web application
. Wireless
. Cloud
. Social

==== Penetration Testing Methodology

===== Reconnaissance
. Open Source Intelligence Gathering
.. Look for sub-domains:

	sublist3r -d <domainname> -t3 -o <filename.txt>

.. Look for sub-domains, users, etc:

	theharvester -d <domainname> -b all -f <outputfilename>

. Discovery Scan

	nmap -sC -sV -oA foldername/filename IPAddress
	nmap -sC -sV -oA foldername/filename -iL <inputfilename>

. Recon scan all ports
	
	nmap -p- -v -oA foldername/filename-allports IPAddress

. If webservers are found perform web server enumeration:

	dirb -d <domainname> 
	gobuster 

. Take notes of all the findings and also include screen captures.

==== Penetration Testing Tools

===== Arpspoof

===== Bloodhound
BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a PowerShell/C# ingestor.

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attacks can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.

BloodHound is developed by @_wald0, @CptJesus, and @harmj0y.

===== Cookie Crimes

If you steal someone’s Chrome cookies, you can log in to their accounts on every website they’re logged in to.

Normally you need the user’s password to do it, but I found a way to do it without the password. You just need to be able to execute code on their computer. It works by using Chrome’s Remote Debugging Protocol.

===== CherryTree
Chery Tree is a note taking app

===== Chisel

===== Crackmapexec
CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. Built with stealth in mind, CME follows the concept of "Living off the Land": abusing built-in Active Directory features/protocols to achieve it's functionality and allowing it to evade most endpoint protection/IDS/IPS solutions.

Usage:
	crackmapexec smb <IP Of Domain Controller> -u <username> -p '<password>'

===== DIRB

DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.

DIRB comes with a set of pre-configured attack wordlists for easy usage but you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a classic CGI scanner, but remember is a content scanner not a vulnerability scanner.

DIRB main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing. Specially in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by classic web vulnerability scanners. DIRB looks for specific web objects that other generic CGI scanners can’t look for. It doesn’t search vulnerabilities nor does it look for web contents that can be vulnerable.

===== Empire
Empire 3.0 is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell 2.0 Windows agent, and compatibility with Python 2.x/3.x Linux/OS X agents. It is the merger of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at BSidesLV in 2015 and Python EmPyre premeiered at HackMiami 2016. BC-Security presented updates to further evade Microsoft Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and JA3/S signatures at DEF CON 27.

Empire relies heavily on the work from several other projects for its underlying functionality. We have tried to call out a few of those people we've interacted with heavily here and have included author/reference link information in the source of each Empire module as appropriate. If we have failed to properly cite existing or prior work, please let us know at Empire@BC-Security.org.

Empire is developed by @harmj0y, @sixdub, @enigma0x3, @rvrsh3ll, @killswitch_gui, @xorrior, and @bcsecurity1. While the main fork for Empire is no longer maintained, this fork is maintained by BC-Security and will continue to receive periodic updates.

===== JQ
jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

jq is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime dependencies. You can download a single binary, scp it to a far away machine of the same type, and expect it to work.

jq can mangle the data format that you have into the one that you want with very little effort, and the program to do so is often shorter and simpler than you’d expect.

===== Nikto
Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.

Nikto is not designed as a stealthy tool. It will test a web server in the quickest time possible, and is obvious in log files or to an IPS/IDS. However, there is support for LibWhisker's anti-IDS methods in case you want to give it a try (or test your IDS system).


Not every check is a security problem, though most are. There are some items that are "info only" type checks that look for things that may not have a security flaw, but the webmaster or security engineer may not know are present on the server. These items are usually marked appropriately in the information printed. There are also some checks for unknown items which have been seen scanned for in log files.

===== Responder
This tool is first an LLMNR and NBT-NS responder, it will answer to *specific* NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix (see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool will only answers to File Server Service request, which is for SMB. The concept behind this, is to target our answers, and be stealthier on the network. This also helps to ensure that we don’t break legitimate NBT-NS behavior. You can set the -r option to 1 via command line if you want this tool to answer to the Workstation Service request name suffix.

Usage Example
Specify the IP address to redirect to (-i 192.168.1.202), enabling the WPAD rogue proxy (-w On), answers for netbios wredir (-r On), and fingerprinting (-f On):

	responder -i 192.168.1.202 -w On -r On -f On

==== Red team Assessment
A Red Team Assessment is similar to a penetration test in many ways but is more targeted. The goal of the Red Team Assessment is NOT to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. The goal is to test the organization's detection and response capabilities. The red team will try to get in and access sensitive information in any way possible, as quietly as possible. The Red Team Assessment emulates a malicious actor targeting attacks and looking to avoid detection, similar to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). (Ugh! I said it…) Red Team Assessments are also normally longer in duration than Penetration Tests. A Penetration Test often takes place over 1-2 weeks, whereas a Red Team Assessment could be over 3-4 weeks or longer, and often consists of multiple people.

A Red Team Assessment does not look for multiple vulnerabilities but for those vulnerabilities that will achieve their goals. The goals are often the same as the Penetration Test. Methods used during a Red Team Assessment include Social Engineering (Physical and Electronic), Wireless, External, and more. A Red Team Assessment is NOT for everyone though and should be performed by organizations with mature security programs. These are organizations that often have penetration tests done, have patched most vulnerabilities, and have generally positive penetration test results.

The Red Team Assessment might consist of the following:

A member of the Red Team poses as a Fed-Ex delivery driver and accesses the building. Once inside, the Team member plants a device on the network for easy remote access. This device tunnels out using a common port allowed outbound, such as port 80, 443, or 53 (HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS), and establishes a command and control (C2) channel to the Red Team's servers. Another Team member picks up the C2 channel and pivots around the network, possibly using insecure printers or other devices that will take the sights off the device placed. The Team members then pivot around the network until they reach their goal, taking their time to avoid detection.

This is just one of innumerable methods a Red Team may operate but is a good example of some tests we have performed.

=== Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized – all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers the questions “Where are the high-value assets?” “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?” “What are the most relevant threats?” “Is there an attack vector that might go unnoticed?

It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.

==== CVSS
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which provides a score to indicate the severity of the CVE vulnerabilities.

Assignment of a CVSS score is based on:

* The primary impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the protected system/resources
* The derivative impact on loss of life and/or properties
* The percentage of the impacted area within the total environment
* How easy it is to exploit the vulnerability
* How easy it is to remediate the vulnerability
* How confident the testing team is about the existence of the vulnerability

==== NVD
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. NVD also provides severity rankings of "Low," "Medium," and "High" in addition to the numeric CVSS scores. These qualitative rankings are simply mapped from the numeric CVSS scores:

* Vulnerabilities are labeled "Low" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 0.0-3.9.
* Vulnerabilities will be labeled "Medium" severity if they have a base CVSS score of 4.0-6.9.
* Vulnerabilities will be labeled "High" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 7.0-10.0.

==== STRIDE
STRIDE is a model of threats developed by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohnfelder at Microsoft[1] for identifying computer security threats.[2] It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.[3]

The threats are:

* **S**poofing of user identity
* **T**ampering
* **R**epudiation
* **I**nformation disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
* **D**enial of service (D.o.S)
* **E**levation of privilege.

==== DREAD
DREAD methodology is used to rate, compare and prioritize the severity of risk presented by each threat that is classified using STRIDE.

* **D**amage
* **R**eproducibility
* **E**xploitability
* **A**ffected Users
* **D**iscoverability

DREAD Risk = (Damage + Reproduciblity + Exploitability + Affected Users + Discoverability) / 5. Calculation always produces a number between 0 and 10. Higher the number means more serious the risk is.

Following is a customized mathematical approach to implement DREAD methodology:-

*Damage Potential*
If a threat exploit occurs, how much damage will be caused?

* 0 = Nothing
* 5 = Information disclosure that could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities
* 8 = Individual/employer non sensitive user data is compromised.
* 9 = Administrative non sensitive data is compromised.
* 10 = Complete system or data destruction.
* 10 = Application unavailability.

*Reproducible*
How easy is it to reproduce the threat exploit?

* 0 = Very hard or impossible, even for administrators of the application.
* 5 = Complex steps are required for authorized user.
* 7.5 = Easy steps for Authenticated user
* 10 = Just a web browser and the address bar is sufficient, without authentication.

*Exploit-ability*
What is needed to exploit this threat?

* 2.5 = Advanced programming and networking knowledge, with custom or advanced attack tools.
* 5 = Exploit exits in public, using available attack tools.
* 9 = A Web Application Proxy tool
* 10 = Just a web browser

*Affected Users*
How many users will be affected?

* 0 = None
* 2.5 individual/employer that is already compromised.
* 6 = some users of individual or employer privileges, but not all.
* 8 = Administrative users
* 10 = All users

*Discover-ability*
How easy is it to discover this threat?

* 0 = Very hard requires source code or administrative access.
* 5 = Can figure it out by monitoring and manipulating HTTP requests
* 8 = Details of faults like this are already in the public domain and can be easily discovered using a search engine.
* 10 = the information is visible in the web browser address bar or in a form.

DREAD methodology can be customized to cater the needs of your application, during consultancy engagements it should be approved from the client before starting the security assessment so that after you perform the analysis the results produced by DREAD couldn’t be challenged.

==== STIX
STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) was originally conceived as a language to describe cyber threat intelligence. This was groundbreaking at the time because it was the first language to provide a definition of cyber threat intelligence. Although it’s a bit of a fuzzy term, cyber threat intelligence generally describes information about adversaries and their behaviors that can inform defensive actions. For example, knowing that a certain adversary targets financial institutions by using specially crafted spear-phishing emails, and then delivers Trojans that will reach out to a certain set of websites that are known to be malicious, can be very helpful in defending against the attack. STIX captures that type of intelligence in a machine-readable form so that it can be shared among organizations and tools.

The DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communications funded MITRE, beginning in 2012, to act as the technical developer of STIX and serve as a community facilitator to jumpstart STIX. Once some level of maturity was reached, STIX would be transitioned to an international standards body. That goal was realized in 2015 when governance of STIX was transitioned to OASIS, an international standards consortium. This was a big step for STIX and a big success for DHS, MITRE, and the community because it meant that STIX was on its way to becoming an international standard. Although DHS and MITRE continue to serve in several leadership positions in the CTI TC, the majority of the leadership and the vast majority of participants in the TC are from industry. In fact, the OASIS CTI TC was founded with more participants than any other TC in OASIS history. It's that community that led the development of STIX 2.0.

==== TAXII
TAXII is a high-level protocol for moving cyber threat intelligence (primarily STIX) data around between systems and tools. We expect that, within the coming months, TAXII will be achieving this same milestone and opening its own public review period.

== Digital Forensics

=== Windows Persistence
Focus on System & Security logs.  Standard artifact utilized in any investigation.

Following log types are important:

. Task logs 
. Events concerning services
.. 7045 - Code for new service installed, should be a low frequency event.
.. 7009 - Service failed to start, what should be running and is not.
.. 7035/7036 - Services being tampered with for malicious purposes. Look for services that have no descrption, and have image path that is in a non standard directory.  DLL is in the same directory as exe, which is a side loading technique. Check for start type, if it is changed to 2, which is auto start. Type 10 means that the service is running under user account authority.
.. 601 - Attempt to install a service
.. 7034 - Service has crashed unexpectedly
. Events concerning schedules tasks
.. 4698 - When a scheduled task is created on a system that has been compromised
.. 4702 - When a scheduled task has been altered
.. 4701/4699 
.. 4700 - A scheduled task has been enabled.

Scheduled tasks with abnormal names or directories.  Attackers usually create a verly long task name.  Check the command syntax.

=== Cortex
Cortex tries to solve a common problem frequently encountered by SOCs, CSIRTs and security researchers in the course of threat intelligence, digital forensics and incident response: how to analyze observables they have collected, at scale, by querying a single tool instead of several?

Cortex, an open source and free software, has been created by TheHive Project for this very purpose. Observables, such as IP and email addresses, URLs, domain names, files or hashes, can be analyzed one by one or in bulk mode using a Web interface. Analysts can also automate these operations thanks to the Cortex REST API.

==== Bulk-extractor
It is a program that extracts features such as email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of information from digital evidence files. It is a useful forensic investigation tool for many tasks such as malware and intrusion investigations, identity investigations and cyber investigations, as well as analyzing imagery and pass-word cracking. The program provides several unusual capabilities including:

* It finds email addresses, URLs and credit card numbers that other tools miss because it can process compressed data (like ZIP, PDF and GZIP ﬁles) and incomplete or partially corrupted data. It can carve JPEGs, office documents and other kinds of files out of fragments of compressed data. It will detect and carve encrypted RAR files.
* It builds word lists based on all of the words found within the data, even those in compressed files that are in unallocated space. Those word lists can be useful for password cracking.
* It is multi-threaded; running bulk_extractor on a computer with twice the number of cores typically makes it complete a run in half the time.
* It creates histograms showing the most common email addresses, URLs, domains, search terms and other kinds of information on the drive.

Link: https://tools.kali.org/forensics/bulk-extractor

==== DensityScout
DensityScout is a tool that has been written for one purpose: finding (possibly unknown) malware on a potentially infected system. Therefore it takes advantage of the typical approach of malware authors to protect their "products" with obfuscation like run-time-packing and -encryption. The tool itself is based on the concept of our Bytehist tool, btw.

*So what does DensityScout do?*
DensityScout's main focus is to scan a desired file-system-path by calculating the density of each file to finally print out an accordingly descending list. Usually most Microsoft Windows executables are not packed or encrypted in any way which throws the hits of malicious executables to the top of the list where one can easily focus on.

*What's Density?*
Density can also be understood as "entropy". However, the algorithm behind density is not 100% equal to the one which entropy is based on. So we decided to choose a different name.

Link: https://www.cert.at/downloads/software/densityscout_en.html

==== Kape
KAPE is a multi-function program that primarily: 

. collects files
. processes collected files with one or more programs.

KAPE reads configuration files on the fly and based on their contents, collects and processes relevant files. This makes KAPE very extensible in that the program’s author does not need to be involved to add or expand functionality.

As we will see later in more detail, KAPE uses the concepts of targets and modules to do its work. KAPE comes with a range of default targets and modules for operations most commonly required in forensic exams. These can also serve as models  for creating new targets and modules.

At a high level, KAPE works by adding file masks to a queue. This queue is then used to find and copy files from a source location. For files that are locked by the operating system, a second run bypasses the lock. At the end of the process, KAPE will make a copy and preserve metadata about all available files from a source location into a given directory. The second (optional) stage of processing is to run one or more programs against the collected data. This too works by targeting either specific file names or directories. Various programs are run against the files, and the output from the programs is then saved in directories named after a category, such as EvidenceOfExecution, BrowserHistory or AccountUsage.

By grouping things by category, examiners of all skill levels have the means to discover relevant information regardless of an individual artifact's source. In other words, an examiner no longer need to know how to process prefetch, shimcache, amcache, userassist, etc., as they relate to evidence of execution artifacts. Ultimately, a wider range of artifacts can be leveraged for any given requirement.

==== Volatility Framework
Digital investigations had focused primarily on finding contraband within hard drive images. Volatility introduced people to the power of analyzing the runtime state of a system using the data found in volatile storage (RAM). It also provided a cross-platform, modular, and extensible platform to encourage further work into this exciting area of research. Another major goal of the project was to encourage the collaboration, innovation, and accessibility to knowledge that had been common within the offensive software communities.

​Since that time, memory analysis has become one of the most important topics to the future of digital investigations and Volatility has become the world’s most widely used memory forensics platform. The project is supported by one of the largest and most active communities in the forensics industry. Volatility also provides a unique platform that enables cutting edge research to be immediately transitioned into the hands of digital investigators. As a result, research built on top of Volatility has appeared at the top academic conferences and Volatility has been used on some of the most critical investigations of the past decade. It has become an indispensible digital investigation tool relied upon by law enforcement, military, academia, and commercial investigators throughout the world.

Volatility development is now supported by The Volatility Foundation, an independent 501(c) (3) non-profit organization. The foundation was established to promote the use of Volatility and memory analysis within the forensics community, to defend the project's intellectual property (trademarks, licenses, etc.) and longevity, and, finally, to help advance innovative memory analysis research. Along these lines, the foundation was also formed to help protect the rights of the developers who sacrifice their time and resources to make the world’s most advanced memory forensics platform free and open source.

*Enterprise* is any organization that is large or small with a collaborative collection of sub-organizations with a shared set of objectives.

*Architecture* is a designed structure of something.  A description of the structure (components) and behaviors (Processes) of a system.  It is also an activity required to produce such a description.

*Enterprise Architecture* is documentation describing the structure and behaviour of an enterprise including its information systems.  Also a process for describing an enterprise(including its information systems), then planning and governing changes to improve the integrity and flexibility of the enterprise.

Frameworks provide guidelines on how to implement enterprise architecture.  Frameworks address following areas:
* Content (strcuture, metamodel)
* Process (activities)
* Organization (roles, people)

Some of the frameworks are:

* TOGAF (covers all three, content, process, and organization)
* Zachman (Purely covers content)
* SABSA
* DODAF
* MODAF

Large organizations are complex, hence they can be broken down into following typical domains

. Business (Why organization exisit, objectives, goals, strategic thinking, capabilities, processes, functions, organizatinal structure)
. Data
. Application(s)
. Technology

Following domains cut across the typical domains:

. Security
. Compliance


*Architecture Activities* typically when you are performing any sort of change, you have to document the current state and future state.  This represents the strategic vision of the organization, where they want to be in 3-5 years time.

Enterprise architecture is about overseeing these changes by defining various architecture principles and standards.  Architects then govern those changes to ensure that the standards and principles are being followed.

=== SABSA
SABSA is a framework that supports the business in reaching its goals.  It is the leading methodology for developing business operational risk-based architectures.  SABSA stands for Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture.

It provides a framework for developing risk driven enterprise information security and information assurance architectures.

It also helps to deliver security infrastructure solutions that help critical business initiatives.

The SABSA methodology provides guidance for aligning architecture with business value, it also addresses a critical need for greater integration between security and enterprise architecture within organizations.

With SABASA organizations can achieve that important risk reward balance using a range of frameworks, models, methods, and process to manage risk and measure performance.

The SABSA model is the key to this and covers the whole lifecycle of operational capabilities.  The SABSA model has six layers:

. Contextual Architecture: The Business View (Business wisdom and business decision making)
. Conceptual Architecture: The Architect's vision (The 'big picture', business attributes profiel and risk objectives)
. Logical Architecture: The Designers Vision (Information, services, processes, applications)
. Physical Architecture: The builders/constructors view(Data mechanisms, infrastructure, platforms)
. Component Architecture: The Trademan's View (Products, Tools, Specific Standards, Technologies)
. Security Services Management Architecture: The Service Manager's view (Service management activities, processes and monitoring)

Each of the layers of the architecture model are supported by a vertical analysis based on six key questions

* What
* Why
* How
* Who
* Where
* When

The SABSA framework is flexible, scalable and applicable to any industry sector.  Instead of replacing other risk based standards, it can be combined with TOGAF, COBIT and ITIL to create an integrated compliance framework.

SABSA provides organization with "enterprise operational risk management architecture" that can be completely tailored to a specific business model. 

SABSA's governance model provide a control feedback loop

Key functions are

Identify:: involves determining your IT risks and securing the necessary budget and resources to defend your digital resources. Your decisions should be based on the contextualized threat intelligence you collect. In addition to assessing internal IT risk, this goal should include analyzing the security competence of third-party vendors and any customers with which you exchange data. It’s critical to identify those that represent an elevated risk to your organization’s systems and data. It’s also important to bring in threat intelligence on the risks your competitors face because you likely face similar threats.

Protect:: is about deploying the required security controls (technologies and processes) to defend your digital assets, and then validating that these controls align to the risks you identified. For example, controls should be applied to set up defenses against exploit kits, as well as undisclosed zero-day and embargoed vulnerabilities, as identified by your threat intelligence platform. You also need to safeguard against the exploitation of high-risk vulnerabilities in your technology stack.

Detect:: revolves around your ability to block attacks before they impact digital assets. Threat intelligence helps by enabling you to identify and research the evolution and trends of malware families with high risk to your organization. In addition to identifying the security patches to apply, you will also gain intelligence on which systems are most susceptible and which are being actively targeted and exploited.

Respond:: refers to how fast your security team reacts to breaches; even the strongest security postures do not offer a 100% guarantee that cyberattacks will not succeed. Threat intelligence assists in the response process by evaluating the data exposure and the digital asset damage your organization is facing. This can then be reported to all affected parties and stakeholders — not only for remediation teams, but also for non-technical personnel who may need to prepare for the impact on day-to-day operations and the potential impact on vendors, clients, and perhaps even the overall market in which you operate.

Recover:: is all about how quickly the damage inflicted upon the organization’s technology stack and surrounding ecosystem can be mitigated, including any and all operations that must be restored as the security incidents are being closed out. Threat intelligence helps pinpoint the specific measures the security team should take in order to quarantine infected systems and inoculate the malicious elements coursing through the environment. The ultimate goal in the case of a breach, of course, is to quickly and safely restore the digital assets back to fully functioning systems with all security measures intact.

Top two are proactive measures, and bottom three are reactive measures.

== Governance, Risk, & Compliance

A documented process must be followed to ensure compliance to security policy and to highlight risks that might be introduced when security policy requirements are not adhered to.  Some of the GRC functions are:

* Enterprise Risk Management
* IT Risk Management
* Integrated Risk Management
* Operational Risk Management
* Compliance
* Enterprise GRC Management
* Vendor/Third-Party Risk Management
* Business Continuity
* Financial Audit

=== Enterprise Risk Management

* Not necessarily covered by insurance
* Multi-dimensional assessment
* Analyzes material risks and how they relate
* Spans the entire organization ("holistic")
* Proactive & continuous
* Considers both upside and downside
* Focuses on business goals, adding value and more
* Embedded in culture and mindset

. The Get-PSProvider cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell providers in the current session. You can get a particular drive or all drives in the session. Windows PowerShell providers let you access a variety of data stores as though they were file system drives. The Get-PSDrive cmdlet gets the drives in the current session. You can get a particular drive or all drives in the session. This cmdlet gets the following types of drives:
.. Windows logical drives on the computer, including drives mapped to network shares.
.. Drives exposed by Windows PowerShell providers (such as the Certificate:, Function:, and Alias: drives) and the HKLM: and HKCU: drives that are exposed by the Windows PowerShell Registry provider.
.. Session-specified temporary drives and persistent mapped network drives that you create by using the New-PSDrive cmdlet.
Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the Persist parameter of the New-PSDrive cmdlet can create mapped network drives that are saved on the local computer and are available in other sessions. For more information, see New-PSDrive. Also, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, when an external drive is connected to the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically adds a PSDrive to the file system that represents the new drive. You do not need to restart Windows PowerShell. Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically deletes the PSDrive that represents the removed drive.
